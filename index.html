    <p>It was a dark and stormy night... Jeff Gray Jr was stuck on the highway, with undetermined 
      car problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      His phone was also dead, so it looked like he was going to have to walk somewhere 
      to try to find help. He grabbed his jacket and headed toward the closest exit. As 
      near as he could tell, it was 600 yards behind him. He had walked about a third of that
      when he heard, off to his left in the woods...
    </p>
    <p>
      Something rustling in the woods. He stopped and looked over his shoulder to investigate, but as soon as he stopped walking 
      the noise stopped too. He started walking again and sure enough, the rustling noise followed. He picked up his pace...
    </p>
    <p>
      And so did whatever was making the noise. Then it began: LAUGHTER. The kind that makes your skin crawl.
